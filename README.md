# Movie Reservation System API

## Introduction
This project is a RESTful API for managing a movie reservation system. It allows users to view available movies, check the availability of specific time slots for movies, and reserve time slots. The API is built using Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB.

## Why Swagger for Documentation?
Swagger (OpenAPI) is used for documenting the API because it offers an interactive, user-friendly interface for exploring and testing the API endpoints. It helps both developers and non-developers understand the API's functionalities, making the development and integration process more efficient and transparent.
